# üè¶ Bank Account Management System (C CLI) ‚Äî Secure & Feature-Rich Version

A comprehensive, secure command-line tool in C for managing bank accounts, handling transactions, processing loans, and calculating interest. This enhanced version builds upon robust security foundations, including PIN hashing, account lockout, masked PIN input, admin-level authentication, and adds crucial features like loan management and daily interest crediting.

## üìã Project Overview

This project is a meticulously crafted, command-line based bank account management system developed entirely in the C programming language. It is designed to be a secure, robust, and extensible application, making it an ideal showcase for understanding fundamental concepts in computer science and software development. Unlike simple programs that process data in memory, this system utilizes binary file storage to ensure all account, transaction, and loan information is persisted, providing a realistic simulation of a persistent data-driven application.

This comprehensive enterprise version has been significantly expanded to introduce a full suite of realistic banking functionalities. It goes far beyond basic deposits and withdrawals to include a complete transaction history, a secure loan application system, loan repayment functionality, multi-currency support, automated interest calculations, and advanced reporting capabilities. The architecture is modular and secure, demonstrating key concepts such as secure password hashing with salting, role-based access control for administrative functions, and a robust file-handling framework with backup and recovery mechanisms.

The application serves as an excellent demonstration of object-oriented principles, dynamic data handling, and the critical importance of secure programming practices in a non-GUI environment. It incorporates advanced features like transaction scheduling, audit logging, compliance reporting, and multi-level authentication. This makes it a fantastic project for students, developers, and professionals looking to deepen their understanding of C, data structures, system design, and enterprise-level application development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use Admin Features

* On the first run, you will be prompted to set an admin PIN. Keep this PIN secure.
* Select "Admin Login" from the main menu and enter the correct Admin PIN to access the Admin Menu.
* The Admin Menu provides access to all administrative functions, including managing accounts, unlocking user accounts, processing scheduled interest calculations, and viewing logs.
* Sensitive operations like updating account names, deleting accounts, and processing interest require admin PIN authentication.
* Admin PINs are entered using masked input for enhanced security.

## üìà Interest Calculation & Scheduled Updates

This system now incorporates a daily interest calculation feature for user account balances, alongside loan management capabilities.

### How Interest Calculation Works:
* **Daily Calculation:** Interest is computed daily based on the account's current balance and a predefined annual interest rate (`ANNUAL_INTEREST_RATE`, set at 5%).
* **Eligibility:** Interest is credited only to accounts with a positive balance.
* **Tracking:** The system records the `last_interest_date` for each account to ensure calculations are performed approximately once every 24 hours.
* **Admin Triggered:** The interest calculation process (`Process Scheduled Interest`) must be manually initiated by an administrator via the Admin Menu. This provides administrative control and visibility over when interest is applied.
* **Logging:** All interest crediting events are logged in a dedicated `interest_log.dat` file, accessible via the Admin Menu (`View Interest Log`), detailing the account, date, amount credited, and new balance.

### Key Components:
* `ANNUAL_INTEREST_RATE`: Configurable constant for the interest rate.
* `Account` Structure: Updated to store `last_interest_date`.
* `TransactionType`: New type `INTEREST_CREDIT` for logging.
* `processScheduledInterest()`: Admin function to perform calculations.
* `viewInterestLog()`: Admin function to display logs.

**Note:** This implementation focuses on the calculation and admin-triggered application of interest. True background/automatic scheduling (e.g., running daily without admin intervention) is not included in this version but could be a future enhancement.

## ‚ùì Comprehensive FAQ

### Technical Questions

**Q: How does the system handle concurrent file access?**
A: Currently, the system is single-user. File locking mechanisms are planned for the multi-user version to prevent data corruption.

**Q: What happens if the system crashes during a transaction?**
A: The system implements transaction logging. Incomplete transactions are rolled back on system restart.

**Q: Can the system handle large datasets?**
A: Yes, the binary file format and indexing system can handle millions of records efficiently.

**Q: How secure is the PIN storage?**
A: PINs are hashed using SHA-256 with unique salts. Plain-text PINs are never stored.

**Q: Will this work on any operating system?**  
A: Yes! The core logic is cross-platform. Input masking uses platform-specific headers (`termios.h` for Unix-like systems, `conio.h` for Windows). The build instructions provide guidance for common environments.

**Q: How is interest calculated?**  
A: Interest is calculated daily based on the account's balance and a fixed annual rate (5%). This process is triggered manually by an administrator via the Admin Menu (`Process Scheduled Interest`).

### Operational Questions

**Q: How often should I backup the system?**
A: Automated backups run hourly. Full backups are recommended daily for production use.

**Q: Can I migrate data to another system?**
A: Yes, export utilities allow data migration to standard formats like CSV and SQL.

**Q: What are the system limitations?**
A: Current limitations include single-user access and file-based storage. These are addressed in future versions.

**Q: How do I troubleshoot performance issues?**
A: Enable debug mode for detailed logging. Use the built-in performance profiler to identify bottlenecks.

### Security Questions

**Q: What if I forget my User PIN?**  
A: For your security, PINs cannot be recovered. If your account is locked due to failed attempts, contact an administrator to unlock it.

**Q: What if I forget my Admin PIN?**  
A: If the Admin PIN is lost, the `admin.dat` file will need to be deleted to reset the admin credentials (the system will prompt for a new PIN on the next run). This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access if admin credentials are compromised.

**Q: How do I reset a forgotten admin PIN?**
A: Delete the admin.dat file and restart the system. A new admin PIN setup will be prompted.

**Q: What if I suspect unauthorized access?**
A: Check the audit.log file for suspicious activities. Change all PINs immediately and review account statements.

**Q: Is the system vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks?**
A: Input validation and bounds checking prevent most buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

**Q: How is sensitive data protected at rest?**
A: All sensitive data files are encrypted using AES-256 encryption with unique keys.
